Research Paper Repository System (C++)

This project implements a simplified Research Paper Repository that models how academic research papers, citations, and research topics can be organized. It supports adding papers, creating citation relationships, finding the most cited papers, computing citation paths, and suggesting research topics based on prefixes using a Trie data structure.

This project is useful for practicing and demonstrating data structures such as tries, hash maps, adjacency lists, heaps, and BFS algorithms.

Features

Add research papers with title and topic

Topic autocomplete using Trie

Directed citation graph between papers

Top-K most cited papers using max-heap

Citation path between papers using BFS

Efficient lookup using hash maps

Data Structures Used

Trie — for autocomplete suggestions

Hash maps — for paper metadata & citation counts

Adjacency List — for storing citations

Max Heap — for top cited paper queries

BFS — for citation path finding
